          <p> My passion has always been creating things that solve a problem and are fun to use whether in fashion or programming. I got my degree in apparel design and fashion merchandising then worked in the film and tv business as a costume designer for almost 10 years. In addition to proficiency in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, I bring strong collaborative skills and thrive in a team environment. Iâ€™m accustomed to performing in fast-paced deadline driven settings with an emphasis on working within budget requirements. My abilities to problem solve and adapt quickly were refined through costume designing and now I am ready to expand those skills in a developer role.</p>
